\subsection*{What Is Nanvix}

Nanvix is a Unix-\/like operating system written by \href{https://github.com/ppenna}{\tt Pedro H. Penna} for educational purposes. It is designed to be simple and small, but also modern and fully featured.

\subsection*{What Hardware Is Required?}

Nanvix targets 32-\/bit x86-\/based P\+Cs and only requires a floppy or C\+D-\/\+R\+OM drive and 16 MB of R\+AM. You can run it either in a real PC or in a virtual machine, using a Live System\textquotesingle{}s Image.

\subsection*{Building}

\subsubsection*{Linux-\/like systems}

In order to build Nanvix, you will need a Linux like programming environment, the x86 G\+CC compiler and the x86 G\+NU binutils.

If you are running a Debian-\/based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu, you can simply run the following commands at the root directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install make
sudo bash tools/dev/setup-toolchain.sh
sudo bash tools/dev/setup-bochs.sh
sudo reboot now
\end{DoxyCode}


When done, you can build Nanvix by typing, at the root directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make nanvix
\end{DoxyCode}


Or you can build a Live System\textquotesingle{}s Image by typing, at the same directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
make image
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{mac\+OS}

The support of Nanvix on mac\+OS is still experimental. It relies on the Homebrew package manager (\href{https://brew.sh}{\tt https\+://brew.\+sh}), to get the necessary U\+N\+I\+X-\/like packages to build Nanvix.

The general flow for building Nanvix on mac\+OS from the root directory is as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
bash tools/dev/setup-toolchain.sh
make TARGET=i386-elf nanvix
make image
\end{DoxyCode}


Unlike the Linux-\/like systems procedure, this flow does not build bochs from source. Instead, it installs the bochs package using brew. As this package does not come with gdb-\/stubs support, you cannot run Nanvix with {\ttfamily -\/-\/debug} option (see details below).

\subsection*{Running}

To run Nanvix, type the following command at the root directory\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
bash tools/run/run.sh
\end{DoxyCode}


The script above accepts some optional parameters to configure bochs. Please, run {\ttfamily bash tools/run/run.\+sh -\/-\/help} for more details.
